0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:18.000
Learn how to take down heavy tanks   
With the smallest tanks

2
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:25.000
Learn the basics to rule the battlefield
with the heavy tanks

3
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:34.000
Learn the difference between useless suicide
and being helful to your team

4
0:00:43.000 --> 0:00:46.000
The T49
Bottom of the foodchain, again?!

5
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:50.000
Analyse your team

6
0:00:51.000 --> 0:00:54.000
Oh great, bottom tank again
Familiar theme in this tank

7
0:00:55.000 --> 0:00:59.000
So what's the best way to hel out our team?
Well this tank has one thing going for it and that's speed

8
0:01:00.000 --> 0:01:05.000
Lets go to a very good spotting bush and help our team
by lighting up the enemy team while they advance.

9
0:01:05.000 --> 0:01:10.000
And then we'll decide what to do from there

10
0:01:18.000 --> 0:01:27.000
Been a while since we last did this, but never forget.
Only exception is if you're in heavy tank and spawned at
the edge of your base.

11
0:01:47.000 --> 0:01:52.000
We're going to that bush, just so you know.

12
0:01:52.000 --> 0:01:56.500
It's perfect spotting bush, unless the enemy has a fast
tank sitting here and sots you as you move up there

13
0:02:11.000 --> 0:02:16.000
From this bush we'll be able to cover this area

14
0:02:19.000 --> 0:02:24.000
Dang it, we're spotted.. Nothing else to do, but move back
and fourth, while shooting at him.

15
0:02:32.500 --> 0:02:38.000
Stopping once in a while to get a more precise shot

16
0:02:48.000 --> 0:02:54.000
Keeping your crosshair on the enemy, even if you're not firing,
just to see when it's safe to move away from this trapped position.

17
0:03:05.000 --> 0:03:10.000
With an AMX12t and an IS pushing, we should push along
and help them by causing a distraction

18
0:03:18.000 --> 0:03:24.000
A T25 AT appears! He could one-shot the T49 if he
got a high damage roll, so keep driving past him

19
0:03:30.000 --> 0:03:34.500
Continue to his rear and stop him from retreating
in any possible way

20
0:03:42.000 --> 0:03:46.500
As you just saw the T49 has an absolutely horrible 
traverse speed.

21
0:03:47.000 --> 0:03:51.000
Remember that to know wich situations you're able to
deal with. This will come into play later as well.

22
0:03:56.000 --> 0:04:01.000
Keep following his rear whereever he goes
to take away any possible way of turning

23
0:04:17.000 --> 0:04:27.000
In most situations you should move after a kill, since
the artillery will still have visual of you for a few
seconds, so he could take a lucky shot and possibly hit you.

24
0:04:44.000 --> 0:04:53.000
An IS-3 and heavily damaged VK3601 popped up. In most situations
you shouldn't go up against tier 8s in a tier 5, but since 
we're the smallest and fastest tank on our team, let's flank him.

25
0:04:56.000 --> 0:05:02.000
Oh and take out any potential targets on the way.

26
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:12.000
The IS-3 just fired, so it's time to use his reload time
against him, so get in close

27
0:05:15.000 --> 0:05:17.000
What was that?

28
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:25.000
This is NOT me just fooling around. THIS is how large the
traverse circle is, when driving at full speed.

29
0:05:25.000 --> 0:05:30.500
Luckily I'm heading straight for that wreck over there,
so let's hide behind it and play peek a boo with him

30
0:05:34.000 --> 0:05:39.000
We're trapped here, so keep going back and forth to keep
him guessing where we'll go

31
0:05:39.000 --> 0:04:44.500
The penetration on the T49 is high enough to penetrate
IS-3 from the side

32
0:05:44.500 --> 0:05:49.500
Keep doing this back and forth untill help can arrive.
We've got a powerful TD coming to help us.

33
0:05:49.500 --> 0:05:54.000
And even if we didn't get help, we'd be annoying
one of the biggest tanks on the enemy team :D

34
0:06:12.000 --> 0:06:17.000
Ouch, better get out of the way, now that the Is-3 has
been dealt with

35
0:06:36.000 --> 0:06:43.000
The rest of the enemies are definitely hiding inside the
forest, so find a decent house to snipe from, when the bigger and more durable tanks advance.

36
0:07:02.000 --> 0:07:07.000
The PzIV was spotted first, so our allies are highly
likely aiming at him first, so shoot once and move onto the next target.

37
0:07:17.000 --> 0:07:22.000
Only big tanks left, so if we want more xp and credits
we have to move in on them

38
0:08:12.500 --> 0:08:20.000
When people are close to dying, they tend to want to have
a final kill to make the loss a little less painful

39
0:08:20.000 --> 0:08:27.500
And you'll see this IS-3 do that and since I had to get
out of the way from it, I unfortunately get hit by a Sherman ally, but that stuff happens.

40
0:08:47.000 --> 0:08:52.000
Thank you for watching

41
0:08:53.000 --> 0:08:58.000
Hope you enjoyed learning that, just because you're at
the bottom of the foodchain, it doesyn't make you useless at all :)

42
0:08:59.000 --> 0:09:05.000
I've been getting a lot of comments on map tactics So I'll
start a series focusing on diffrent tactics for every map

43
0:09:06.000 --> 0:09:11.000
It's going to be a mixture of in-game footage and HP maps
with outlines of routes and flanking possibilities, etc.

44
0:09:12.000 --> 0:09:19.000
Unless you want something else, then please let me know in
the comments.
