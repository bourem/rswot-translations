1
0:00:03.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Analyse your team

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:13.000
Is this mixture of tanks likely to defend or push?

3
0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:18.000
Will they all just find a bush or will they help...

4
0:00:18.000 --> 0:00:25.000
Uuhh look at that long cannon :D

5
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:30.000
Wait what? Oh right, analysing the team

6
0:00:30.000 --> 0:00:36.000
Most of our team consist of big mediums

7
0:00:36.000 --> 0:00:42.000
So helping by scouting on one side probably
won't be a bad idea

8
0:00:55.000 --> 0:00:59.000
Make sure that someone is going your way

9
0:00:59.000 --> 0:01:03.000
If not, then who will hurt the ones you scout?

10
0:01:03.000 --> 0:01:08.000
Circle a few times, while they get into gear

11
0:01:22.000 --> 0:01:26.000
Type 59 and VK3601(H) 
Decent enough

12
0:01:34.000 --> 0:01:38.000
30 seconds into the match

13
0:01:38.000 --> 0:01:43.000
If their scouts would have gone on a suicide
rush, we would have seen them by now

14
0:01:44.000 --> 0:01:48.000
Or I shall find them waiting in a bush up ahead

15
0:02:00.000 --> 0:02:03.000
Keep low.
Stay on the path.

16
0:02:04.000 --> 0:02:07.000
Get a lot closer before breaking cover

17
0:02:08.000 --> 0:02:14.000
If you meet someone, the rocks on the path
will provide excellent cover

18
0:02:21.000 --> 0:02:24.000
First tank spotted.
Don't engage!

19
0:02:25.000 --> 0:02:29.000
You're a spotter first!
A fighter later.
Stay alive!

20
0:02:29.000 --> 0:02:32.000
Nothing's worse than a wasted scout

21
0:02:42.000 --> 0:02:45.000
The first hit.
Don't panic!

22
0:02:45.000 --> 0:02:49.000
Panic leads to mistakes

23
0:02:50.000 --> 0:02:57.000
Most people would go left and go
straight for arty

24
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:01.000
But look at the minimap

25
0:03:01.000 --> 0:03:07.000
They're all in defensive positions.
Proceed to the right

26
0:03:29.000 --> 0:03:36.000
We JUST dodged a shot from their
biggest tank destroyer.
Do NOT push your luck!

27
0:03:37.000 --> 0:03:42.000
Pull back and let the situation unfold

28
0:03:59.000 --> 0:04:05.000
An enemy Type 59 is zoned in on our teammate

29
0:04:05.000 --> 0:04:14.000
When you can easily tell that your
opponent is blinded by bloodlust,
that is the perfect moment to strike!

30
0:04:32.000 --> 0:04:36.000
Don't get too greedy

31
0:04:36.000 --> 0:04:43.000
We just got him 4 times + setting him on fire.
Time to retreat for now.

32
0:04:43.000 --> 0:04:49.000
Also his mates are coming on the left

33
0:05:11.000 --> 0:05:15.000
Never forget your latest intel

34
0:05:15.000 --> 0:05:20.000
We scouted that ISU ourselves and he's still there

35
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:26.000
Quickly take a zoomed in peek to see what he's up to

36
0:05:27.000 --> 0:05:30.000
When the coast is clear, move along

37
0:05:49.000 --> 0:05:52.000
Know your map locations

38
0:05:52.000 --> 0:06:03.000
We could easily sit here safely and take shots on
the Löwe, since the ISU couldn't get out of his
cover without putting himself into a dangerous position

39
0:06:20.000 --> 0:06:24.000
Know the weakness of your enemy

40
0:06:24.000 --> 0:06:29.000
Breaking cover with a sharp turn is something
the ISU's accuracy doesn't like

41
0:06:30.000 --> 0:06:35.000
Also you'd already be halfway across the entrance
when spotted by him

42
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:46.000
Use your third person view to your advantage

43
0:06:46.000 --> 0:06:50.000
Spot an opening and roll out!

44
0:07:06.000 --> 0:07:09.000
Make your enemy completely helpless

45
0:07:32.000 --> 0:07:35.000
Never straight towards an enemy!

46
0:07:35.000 --> 0:07:39.000
Turn at the first opportunity you get!

47
0:07:48.000 --> 0:07:51.000
The guessing game

48
0:07:51.000 --> 0:07:55.000
You can go left or you can go right

49
0:07:55.000 --> 0:08:00.000
He can stay put or he can turn around to face you

50
0:08:16.000 --> 0:08:22.000
Always be at the other end of the cannon!
No matter what tier tank

51
0:08:28.000 --> 0:08:34.000
The only time you're allowed
to go straight at an enemy

52
0:08:34.000 --> 0:08:40.000
When you know that he has JUST fired
and his reload time is long

53
0:09:09.000 --> 0:09:14.000
The only reason I went for this shot was?

54
0:09:14.000 --> 0:09:20.000
That's right, friends!
The Tiger just fired upon me seconds ago
and is now reloading

55
0:09:30.000 --> 0:09:35.000
Know your limits!

56
0:09:35.000 --> 0:09:41.000
Here I knew that I could take a shot from the tiger
and still live

57
0:09:53.000 --> 0:09:58.000
From here it's simply go for the artillery

58
0:10:03.000 --> 0:10:08.000
Don't believe everything you read
"we have the worst arty ever seen"

59
0:10:08.000 --> 0:10:14.000
Rewind the video and watch how our artillery
hits their Löwe and nearly kills it
by setting it on fire and doing direct damage

60
0:10:43.000 --> 0:10:48.000
Wait did it just say Base Captured?! 

61
0:10:51.000 --> 0:10:57.000
"Confederate"
"Scout"

62
0:10:59.000 --> 0:11:05.000
Thank you for watching!

63
0:11:05.000 --> 0:11:10.000
I really hope you enjoyed this video
and had a fun time learning

64
0:11:11.000 --> 0:11:16.000
More videos with running tips coming soon!

65
0:11:25.000 --> 0:11:27.000
I like this tune. \o/

66
0:11:27.000 --> 0:11:28.000
